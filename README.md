## **Introduction**  

`batScript` is a ***procedural***, ***dynamic scripting language*** designed to **bring a more modern coding experience to Windows batch scripts (`.bat`)**.  
Similar to how *TypeScript* compiles to *JavaScript*, **`batScript` code files (`.bts`) are compiled into `.bat` files by the `batScript` compiler, `bsc`**.  
`batScript` is implemented in **`C#`** and offers plugins for both *Visual Studio Code* and *Visual Studio*.

## **Features**  

`batScript` enhances the functionality of `.bat` scripting with the following features:  

- A **type system**, including native support for `int`, `str`, `bool`, `num` (*arbitrary precision decimals*), `arr` (*one-dimensional arrays*), as well as **variable and constant declarations**  
- **Modern control flow structures**, including `if-elif-else`, `while`, and `iterate` (*iterative loops*)  
- Proper **commenting support**  
- Standard **operators**  
- **Functions**  
- A basic **namespace system**  
- Basic **exception handling**  
- **Native support** for embedding raw `bat` commands: execute string-based commands (*including string variables*)  
- A **module system**  
- A **standard library**  
- Additional features commonly found in **modern programming languages**
